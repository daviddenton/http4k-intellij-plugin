# http4k Project Wizard IntelliJ Plugin

This plugin generates boilerplate http4k-based projects with ease by integrating a project wizard into IntelliJ IDEA. It streamlines the process of creating new
http4k projects by providing a user-friendly interface within the IDE and access to the [http4k Toolbox](https://toolbox.http4k.org).
