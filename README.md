This plugin generates boilerplate http4k-based projects with ease by integrating a project wizard into IntelliJ IDEA. It streamlines the process of creating new
http4k projects by providing a user-friendly interface within the IDE and access to the [http4k Toolbox](https://toolbox.http4k.org).

### How to use

Simply create a new IntelliJ project and select the http4k option from the left panel. The Wizard will guide you through a set of questions which will allow you
to select a bunch of modules from the http4k ecosystem, including build tooling.

The generated project will be fully functional, including template tests and a run configuration for the main application class.
